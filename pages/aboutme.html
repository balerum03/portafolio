          <p>About Me</p>
          <p class="h5 m-3">Hi, my name is Adan Fernandez, and for the most part, I've been working in the customer service industry for different worldwide companies as well as for companies in the USA, and if I have learned something is how to understand the needs of people.
            During all of that time that I worked as a customer service agent, there was not a single time that I stopped thinking that I could solve a lot of  customer's problems using software or even on my end as the agent sometimes I was like "I can improve this program so that I can be more productive"
            I knew that could be done because when I was in high school, I had a class where I got to know a bit of how software and computers worked, after high school, I went to university and studied computer science so, that feeling of making things better by using software was only getting stronger every day.
            So, I finally started focussing 100% on programming, I quit my job, joined Microverse, and that gave me the opportunity to work remotely with people around the world in realtime, building on the knowledge I had, building a lot of different projects using different tools(HTML / CSS3 / Ruby on Rails), solving problems, codding challenges, making sure I get better every time.
            At this point, I'm sure that I can build amazing apps to solved problems based on ideas, solve business puzzles using code. I love to see business grow with the help of code, I do not want to keep on doing the same task for the rest of my life, I want to create amazing things using code and make people's lifes better with them.
            Programming is my passion, and from the very first day I started programming till now there hasn't been a doubt. I want to be a software developer for the rest of my life.</p>
